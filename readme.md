Vehicle address logger
----------------------

_Another_ one of your shitty scripts on GitHub?

Yeah, I like to keep my shit here.

-----------------------------------------

Simply logs the address of the entered vehicle in AddressLog/AddressLog.log in hex format. Also copies this to the Windows Clipboard. So you can dump it in ReClass or something.
